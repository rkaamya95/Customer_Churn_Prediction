# Customer_Churn_Prediction

Customer Churn or Customer Attrition refers to the rate at which a business loses customers [1]. It is the rate or percentage of an organization’s customers that stopped using its product or service offerings during a specific time frame [1]. This is considered a very important metric to look at since it is more expensive to acquire new customers than it is to retain one. Churn analysis provides detailed insights on the different factors that affect an organization’s churn rate. It is important to know and understand Customer Churn especially for companies as it significantly affects not only profit and revenue but also long-term growth. Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn [2]. With this project, we will be focusing on churn prediction in the telecom industry. Customer Attrition attracts a lot of attention in the tele-communication industry due to its subscription type business model. Also, high competition amongst several service providers tempts customers to move from one provider to another [2]. The goal of our project is to build classification models that consider certain features from the selected dataset and classify whether a customer falls under the churn category or not. Since these models predict potential customer attrition, it would allow companies to focus on customer retention marketing programs on the subset of those customers who are most vulnerable to leave.
